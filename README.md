## the big Nothing

the big Nothing is a little 2D top down game that I've started to write as soon as I began to learn Java.
The main skeletton for the code was done while following the good old, always dependable, Youtube tutorials.

The game's main idea is quite simple. A (maybe post-apocalyptic...) open world RPG with a Pokemon meets CyberPunk aehstectic, and a kinda over the top sense of humor รก lรก Rick&Morty.

The game is still in it's embryonical state but all feedback is appreciated since I barely know what am doing :)
