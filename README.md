## the big Nothing

the big Nothing is a little 2D top down game that I've started to write as soon as I began to learn Java.
The main skeletton for the code was done while following the good old, always dependable, Youtube tutorials.

The game's main idea is quite simple. A (maybe post-apocalyptic...) open world RPG with a Pokemon meets CyberPunk aehstectic, and a kinda over the top sense of humor รก lรก Rick&Morty.

The game is still in it's embryonical state but all feedback is appreciated since I barely know what am doing :)

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
